##I/O/D - Web Stalker

I love the idea of a browser that encourages interaction with the website. However, I understand why unfortunately this is not a good format for the web. As fun as it is, it would definitely break many websites and make them less user-friendly. At the end of the day, one of the modern internet’s biggest selling points is how user friendly it is even to inexperienced users.

Web Stalker used this point of difference to differentiate itself from Netscape and Microsoft. I thought it was a really important point too that in the Web Stalker’s new format it was harder to have effective ads. I also liked the Web Stalker’s vision of making surfing the web more exciting and less like merely pulling up files on a computer.  I also found the quote from Alex Galloway that the author provided to be very insightful: “The Web Stalker doesn't produce art but, in Matthew Fuller's words, ‘produces a relationship to art.’ The Stalker slips into a new category, the ‘not-just-art’ that exists when revolutionary thinking is supplemented by aesthetic production”

I also really liked the tidbit that the acronym IOD “stands for everything it is possible for it to stand for.”

##I Have Nothing to Say and I’m Saying It

I was initially charmed by the creative use of the tools provided by the internet things such as fax jams. Because these artists were intimately familiar with the internet they could find these loopholes through which they could attack. I also thought it was really interesting in the excerpt titled “Electronic Civil Disobedience” about how power dynamics based on the flow of capital had transitioned online. Thus, the most effective method of resistance was also online. It was also quite notable that the niche Zapatista movement was able to find support online. I liked the idea of the “virtual sit-in” as well. I saw it as a digital evolution of the traditional methods of peaceful protest. I also thought it was so creative that they reloaded non-existent file paths to send messages to the enemy.

I found the divide in the thinking between corporations and the activists interesting as well. While corporations operated under the notion that “content is king” activists operated under the notion that “context is king.” I think that this is a very interesting approach because a website can have such a deeper meaning when it gets the user to think about the form of the internet and its limitations.

I thought that the section about the computer-generated ads was hilarious. Later the author wrote that “adherence to style trumps any underlying message.” Corporate jargon can often be so stale and lifeless that making it completely meaningless really highlights the lack of creativity in non-ironic internet advertisements.
