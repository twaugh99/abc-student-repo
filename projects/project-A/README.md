 # **Dog-Themed "Malware" Puzzle__

#### What I Learned / Enjoyed

I had a good time working on this project. I have always found it amusing to use code to do jarring and impractical things. While working on this project, I became more comfortable with a variety of jarring and impractical javascript functions. I will admit, however, that by the end of working on this project I was really sick of closing pop-up windows and the "are you sure you want to leave this site?" warning pop-ups.

I enjoyed being able to photoshop a distorted image for this project. I really enjoy heavily distorted or "deep-fried" pictures. Normally, web developers strive to design calming and minimalist UX. In this project, however, because it was inspired by malware and poor css, I really enjoyed being able to explore some jarring visual effects.

One thing that I am particularly proud of is the barking. When the user first starts the puzzle, there are 12 tracks of dogs barking playing simultaneously. The tracks are muted whenever the user correctly places a puzzle piece. The sound is unmuted if they move it away from the correct place. I think that this is a really important part of the website because it allows users to know whether or not they are doing it correctly. 12 tracks of dogs barking also creates the "malware" effect where a bunch of stuff is rapidly opening on the computer, resulting (hopefully) in an overwhelming sensation for the user.


#### Challenges

There were a couple of things that I was disappointed that I was unable to do. First, I was unable to apply boolean pop-up parameters such as "resizable", "scrollable", "titlebar" etc. Although I am still very happy with the final iteration, I think the fact that these were impossible to implement was detrimental to the final version of my project.

I was also struggling with the "dragend" event listener but with Leon's help I was able to get the mechanism to work using a different strategy. (Using a setInterval() function that repeatedly checks if the puzzle is solved).
