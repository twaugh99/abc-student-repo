# Coding Foundation Exercise

## I won't lie, I felt pretty rusty while working on this. It even took me a few minutes to even remember how to link my script.js file to my index.html file. The last couple of coding classes that I've taken used Python and p5.js respectively.

## It also took me a while to figure out that I needed to put the lines of code that defined 'img' as document.createElement('img') and the image's source inside of my for loop.

## However, as I continued to work on the assignment, my coding experience began to come back to me. I'm looking forward to getting back into coding this semester.
